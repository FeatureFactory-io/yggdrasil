# Activity: Process Change Request

**Activity ID**: 103
**Order**: 8
**Phase**: Construction
**Dependencies**: Predecessor: Activity 102 (Finalize Feature)

## Description

Process Change Request

## Guidance

## Purpose
Process an enhancement or change request by reconciling requirements across the spec stack, agreeing a target state with the user, then closing with an approved reconciliation record and in-place spec updates. This activity does **not** implement code.

## Requirements Sources

Reconcile across all layers that exist in this project. Read what is present; skip absent layers and note the gap in the matrix.

For each affected Screen ID, build a reconciliation matrix:

| Layer | Typical source | Activity | Current state | Drift? | Notes |
|-------|----------------|----------|---------------|--------|-------|
| User journey | User Journey document | Define User Journey | — | Y/N | Screen narrative |
| Scenarios | Feature files (Gherkin) | Write Feature Files | — | Y/N | Executable requirements |
| Mockups | HTML mockups / prototypes | Create Mockups | — | Y/N | UX validation screens |
| Screen flow | Dialogue map | Create Dialogue Maps | — | Y/N | Navigation flow |
| IA guidelines | IA guidelines | Define Information Architecture | — | Y/N | Design system rules |
| Prior plan | Implementation plan | Plan Feature | — | Y/N | What was planned |
| Architecture | SAO.md | Write SAO.md | — | Y/N | As-designed constraints |
| As-built | Code, templates, tests | BPE-02–07 | — | Y/N | What shipped |

## Steps

### 1. Reconcile Requirements (read-only first)

- Read inputs per ## Inputs below
- Read the change request thoroughly; identify affected Screen IDs and scope
- Read user journey — locate affected screen sections
- Read feature files — locate affected scenarios
- Read mockups — locate affected prototype screens
- Read screen flow and IA guidelines when UI or navigation is in scope
- Read SAO.md for architectural constraints touched by the change
- Inspect as-built code and tests for the same Screen IDs
- Flag conflicts between layers; **do NOT assume** — list open questions
- If you don't understand user intent or UX details — ASK

**Fast path:** If the matrix shows **zero drift** across all present spec layers and the change is purely cosmetic with no scenario impact, document the empty matrix and note minimal delta in the reconciliation document.

### 2. Propose Target State

- Draft **in-place revisions** to canonical consumed artifacts (only layers where drift was found). Do not create parallel "Updated *" copies — revise the same User Journey, Feature Files, Mockups, Screen Flow, and IA documents the project already uses.
- Create **Change Reconciliation Document** at `docs/plans/{FEAT}_CHANGE_RECONCILIATION.md` containing:
  - Trigger (change request summary)
  - Reconciliation matrix (from Step 1)
  - Proposed spec diffs (summary + file paths)
  - Open questions for user
  - Fast-path justification (if applicable)
- Present target state to user; ask clarification questions
- **Gate:** User must approve target state before closing this activity

### 3. Close Reconciliation

- Ensure approved **Change Reconciliation Document** is saved at `docs/plans/{FEAT}_CHANGE_RECONCILIATION.md`
- Ensure in-place revisions to canonical spec artifacts are complete (Step 2)
- **Technical replanning and implementation are out of scope for this activity** — the human may invoke Plan Feature (Activity 96) separately when ready

## Rules to Follow

### I. Do Not Assume
If unclear — ASK. Never guess user intent or implementation details.

### II. Spec Before Code
Reconcile and update requirements artifacts before any implementation planning or coding.

### III. No Execution in Process Change Request
Implementation, testing, and commits happen in later Build Feature activities after separate planning approval.

### IV. Traceability
Every affected Screen ID must appear consistently across all present spec layers. Verify with project grep conventions.

## Success Criteria
- Change request captured and understood
- Reconciliation matrix complete for all affected Screen IDs
- Canonical spec artifacts revised in place or explicitly marked unchanged (fast path)
- Change Reconciliation Document created, saved, and user-approved
- No code changes made during this activity

## Core Principles

### 1. Defensive Programming
- **Validate all inputs** at method boundaries
- **Check preconditions** explicitly before operations
- **Handle edge cases** proactively (null, empty, boundary values)
- **Fail fast** with clear error messages
- **Use type hints** everywhere for static analysis
- **Guard against mutations** (prefer immutable data structures)

### 2. Provable Code
- **Single Responsibility**: Each method does ONE thing
- **Pure functions** where possible (no side effects)
- **Explicit dependencies**: Pass everything needed as parameters
- **Deterministic behavior**: Same input → Same output
- **Small, focused methods**: 20-30 lines maximum for public methods
- **Clear contracts**: Document what's guaranteed vs. what's not

### 3. Observable Code
- **Log at decision points**: Why did we take this branch?
- **Log state transitions**: What changed and why?
- **Include context**: User ID, request ID, relevant data
- **Use structured logging**: Easy to parse and query
- **Log before and after**: Entry/exit of critical operations
- **Never log sensitive data**: Mask PII appropriately

### 4. Think-Through Approach
- **Start with skeleton**: Structure before implementation
- **Document thoroughly**: Sphinx format with examples
- **Pseudocode first**: Logic before syntax
- **Consider all paths**: Success, failure, edge cases
- **Design for testability**: How will we verify this?

### 5. Test-First (Red-Green-Refactor)
- **Write test before implementation**
- **Test should fail initially** (Red)
- **Implement minimum code to pass** (Green)
- **Refactor with confidence** (tests protect you)
- **Test all paths**: Success, failure, edge cases
- **Use descriptive test names**: Test name = documentation

### 6. Clean Code Principles
- **Meaningful names**: Variables, functions, classes tell their purpose
- **Functions do one thing**: Single Responsibility
- **No magic numbers**: Use named constants
- **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself
- **Boy Scout Rule**: Leave code cleaner than you found it
- **Consistent formatting**: Follow project style guide

### 7. SOLID Principles
- Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion

### 8. Self-Documented Code
- **Code explains "what" and "how"**
- **Comments explain "why"**
- **Use type hints**: They're documentation
- **Descriptive variable names**: No abbreviations unless obvious
- **Examples in docstrings**: Show usage
- **Codebase as learning materials**: Add references for advanced concepts

## Workflow

1. **Understand Requirements** — Read spec, identify edge cases, list assumptions
2. **Design (Think-Through)** — Skeleton, docstrings, pseudocode, testable units
3. **Write Tests (Red)** — Happy path, errors, edge cases, boundary conditions
4. **Implement (Green)** — Minimum code to pass, defensive checks, logging
5. **Refactor** — Extract helpers, remove duplication, improve naming, SOLID
6. **Verify** — All tests pass, coverage adequate, logs informative, docs complete

## Checklist for Every Method

- [ ] Sphinx-formatted docstring with :param:, :return:, :raises:
- [ ] Type hints on all parameters and return
- [ ] Input validation with clear error messages
- [ ] Logging at entry, exit, and decision points
- [ ] Tests for success, failure, and edge cases
- [ ] Method is < 30 lines (extract helpers if needed)
- [ ] No magic numbers (use named constants)
- [ ] Follows single responsibility principle
- [ ] Self-documenting variable names
- [ ] Comments explain "why", not "what"

## Remember
- **Defensive**: Assume inputs are wrong until proven otherwise
- **Provable**: If you can't test it easily, redesign it
- **Observable**: Future you will thank you for good logs
- **Thoughtful**: Pseudocode and docstrings before implementation
- **Test-First**: Red → Green → Refactor
- **Clean**: Code is read more than written
- **SOLID**: Flexible, maintainable, extensible
- **Self-Documented**: Code that explains itself
