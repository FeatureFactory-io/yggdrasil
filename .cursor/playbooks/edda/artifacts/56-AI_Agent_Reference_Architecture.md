# How to use this document

**Audience:** Solution architects and implementers running DTA-19 (Define AI Agent Architecture) and filling SAO §17.

**Workflow:**

1. Read **Part 1 — Components** and confirm infra, model, optional vector tier, framework packages, memory tiers, and observability baseline.
2. Pick one or more **Part 2 — Design patterns**; each pattern lists required **SC-xx** scenarios and **CAP-xxx** bundles.
3. Choose **Part 3 — Serving mode** (real-time chat, batch/queue, or both).
4. Tick capabilities in **Part 4.1 Capability table**; copy matching **Part 4.2 Capability specifications** into your repo.
5. Wire packages per **Part 4.3 Module wiring**; start from the closest **Part 4.4 Assembly template**.
6. Prove integration with **Part 4.5 Integration proof** tests before release.

**Rules:**

- Select **capabilities** (`CAP-xxx`), not modules — modules are package-location hints only.
- Every CAP spec is self-contained; no external codebase is required to understand it.
- Delete CAP blocks you did not select; the only allowed LLM mock is **CAP-004** ScriptedLLM.
- Structured JSON from LLM (bootstrap, discovery, map/extract) → Pattern 2 / **SC-02** + **CAP-008** + **CAP-009** mandatory.
- Unsure which pattern? Use **Part 5 — Quick reference** decision trees.
- Large domain state in chat → **CAP-037** snapshot + **CAP-039** dual tool exposure.
- Need memory beyond a hot snapshot → **Component 5 — Memory** tier decision tree before CAP-091–094.
- Background plan/worker selected → never execute pre-defined steps as dumb scripts — see **Pattern 4 · Anti-patterns**.
- Production agent → **CAP-101** interaction trace (`correlation_id` + normalized usage/cost/latency at CAP-001 boundary).
- Dual path **CAP-037–039**: required when domain state is large; default in **T-01**; optional in bare SC-01 minimum.
- Background steps that call the LLM → include **CAP-053, CAP-054, CAP-066** (mandatory when worker runs LLM per step; see Pattern 4 anti-patterns).

**Reference implementation note:** Code samples use Django ORM and Celery as the reference stack. Substitute equivalent transaction-commit hooks and a task broker in other frameworks — preserve the contracts (on_commit enqueue, acks_late, durable plan rows).

# Part 1 — Agentic architecture and key components

## 1.0 Architecture overview

Agentic systems stack infrastructure, model access, optional retrieval, orchestration packages, memory, design patterns, serving modes, and observability. Components are **composable** — pick only what your patterns require.

```text
Infra (env, secrets, broker)
  → Model layer (BaseLLM, adapters, tiers)
  → Vector tier (optional — embeddings + index)
  → Framework packages (factory, loop, plan, worker, tools, …)
  → Memory tiers (snapshot, semantic, profile, notes, reference library)
  → Design patterns (Part 2)
  → Serving mode (Part 3 — real-time and/or batch)
  → Observability (correlation_id, SSE, usage/cost trace)
```

## 1.1 Component 1 — Infra layer

The infra layer supplies **environment configuration**, **secret handling**, **LLM provider readiness**, and (when async plans are used) **message broker + result backend**. Agents must fail fast when infra is misconfigured — never silently fall back to wrong models or missing credentials.

### Environment contract

| Variable | Purpose | Required when |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | Adapter selection: `anthropic`, `openai`, `ollama`, … | Always |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Cloud provider auth | Matching provider |
| `OLLAMA_HOST` | Base URL for local Ollama (default `http://127.0.0.1:11434`) | `LLM_PROVIDER=ollama` |
| `LLM_OLLAMA_MODEL` | Default Ollama model tag | Ollama provider |
| `LLM_TIER_<NAME>` | Maps named tier → model id (planning / execution / field) | CAP-122 |
| `CELERY_BROKER_URL` | Task queue broker (or equivalent) | CAP-060 |
| `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND` | Task results store (or equivalent) | CAP-060 |
| `CORRELATION_ID_HEADER` | HTTP header name (default `X-Correlation-ID`) | CAP-101 |

### Ollama readiness

Before accepting traffic with `LLM_PROVIDER=ollama`:

1. Confirm Ollama daemon is running on `OLLAMA_HOST`.
2. Probe `GET {OLLAMA_HOST}/api/tags` or `GET {OLLAMA_HOST}/api/ps` — non-200 → **fail startup** (do not queue requests against a dead local LLM).
3. Verify configured model tag appears in `/api/tags`; if missing, log explicit pull instruction (`ollama pull <model>`).
4. Health endpoint on your API should surface LLM readiness separately from DB readiness.

### Secrets policy

- API keys live **server-side only** — environment variables or secret manager; never in frontend bundles, MCP stdio client env exposed to IDE extensions without review, or committed config.
- Tool calls that mutate data must receive **server-injected identity** (CAP-036) — never trust client-supplied user ids for writes.
- Log redaction: never log full API keys or raw tool payloads containing secrets.

### Worker infra checklist (SC-01 / SC-03)

When background plan execution is selected:

- [ ] Broker reachable from worker process
- [ ] `acks_late=True` and visibility timeout > max task duration (CAP-063)
- [ ] Result backend sized for plan metadata (not full LLM transcripts unless required)
- [ ] Beat/cron for orphan recovery if CAP-064 selected
- [ ] Rate-limit handling: CAP-061 dual-layer 429 (in-call backoff + job `waiting_retry`)

---

## 1.2 Component 2 — Model layer

The model layer isolates vendor SDKs behind a **provider-agnostic port**. All agent code depends on **CAP-001** `BaseLLM`, not Anthropic/OpenAI/Ollama directly.

**Core responsibilities:**

| Concern | CAP-IDs | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Single completion entry | CAP-001 | `complete(messages, system, tools?, …) -> LLMResponse` |
| Tool-calling generate | CAP-002 | Normalized `tool_calls` list in response |
| Token streaming | CAP-003 | Iterator/stream for live UI |
| Test seam | CAP-004 | ScriptedLLM — **only** allowed LLM mock |
| Retry / backoff | CAP-005, CAP-006 | Exponential backoff + status callback |
| Extended thinking | CAP-007, CAP-008 | Provider reasoning budget; adapter splits thinking vs content |
| Structured JSON extract | CAP-009 | Strip fences; parse array/object — fail loud |
| Prompt cache blocks | CAP-010 | Ephemeral cache on stable system layers |
| Provider factory | CAP-011 | Select adapter from env |
| Model tiers | CAP-122 | planning / execution / field mapping |

Implement adapters in `llm/adapters/`; wire via `build_llm_for_tier()` in factory (CAP-120). Full specs: **Part 4.2**.

---

## 1.3 Component 3 — Vector stores and embeddings

Add a vector tier when **semantic retrieval** is required and brute-force JSON snapshots or SQL search are insufficient.

**When to add**

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Pattern 2 / SC-02 with document corpus | Index chunks for `search_knowledge` (CAP-090 + CAP-094) |
| Tier 2 semantic memory (CAP-091) | Embed entity text fields or note bodies |
| Snapshot exceeds token budget | Query-time retrieval instead of full layer-4 dump |

**Minimal interfaces**

```python
def embed_text(text: str, *, model: str | None = None) -> list[float]: ...

class VectorIndex:
    def upsert(self, scope_id: str, doc_id: str, chunks: list[dict]) -> None: ...
    def query(self, scope_id: str, embedding: list[float], *, limit: int = 20) -> list[dict]: ...
```

**Backend comparison (pick one per deployment)**

| Backend | Best for | Trade-offs |
|---------|----------|------------|
| pgvector (Postgres extension) | Single-DB apps; transactional ingest | Couples search to DB load |
| Dedicated vector DB | High QPS semantic search | Extra service to operate |
| In-process / dev index | Local dev, tests | Not durable; no horizontal scale |

**Index lifecycle:** ingest → chunk (fixed size + overlap) → embed → upsert metadata `{scope_id, doc_type, title, version}` → query at tool-call time. Re-ingest bumps version; CAP-090 searches latest index only.

Wire CAP-090/091/094 specs in **Part 4.2** when this component is selected.

---

## 1.4 Component 4 — Agent framework (internal orchestration)

This architecture uses **first-party packages** — not LangChain, CrewAI, or AutoGen. Orchestration is explicit: factory composes LLM + tools + prompt; loop runs bounded ReAct; plan persists steps; worker executes async.

**Package map**

```text
llm/            CAP-001–011      Model port + adapters
prompt/         CAP-020–023      Layered prompt stack
tools/          CAP-030–036      Registry, envelope, HITL, guards
context/        CAP-037–039      Snapshot + dual tool exposure
loop/           CAP-040–044      Bounded ReAct + plan handoff
plan/           CAP-050–055      Durable steps + synthesis chain
worker/         CAP-060–066      Async execution + 429 handling
blackboard/     CAP-070–073      Soft multi-turn intent
learning/       CAP-080–081      Optional outcome capture
knowledge/      CAP-090–094      RAG + memory tiers
streaming/      CAP-100          SSE progress events
events/         CAP-110          Domain event ingress
observability/  CAP-101          Interaction trace
factory/        CAP-120–122      Composition root + identities
```

**Composition root (CAP-120):** single place that constructs `PlannerAgent`, `FieldAgent`, or pipeline worker with injected dependencies.

**Forbidden imports**

- `tools/` must not import `loop/`
- `llm/` must not import domain apps
- `loop/` must not own business rules — calls tools only
- `context/` must not import `loop/` or `worker/`
- `observability/` must not import domain mutation paths — record only

Full dependency matrix and diagram: **Part 4.3**.

---

## 1.5 Component 5 — Memory

Stack memory **tiers by access pattern** — do not pick one strategy for everything.

| Tier | Name | When | CAP-IDs | Freshness |
|------|------|------|---------|-----------|
| 1 | Hot snapshot | SC-01 chat; domain fits structured JSON | CAP-037, CAP-038, CAP-039 | TTL cache; invalidate on mutation |
| 2 | Semantic retrieval | Snapshot too large; NL lookup | CAP-091 | Query-time embedding search |
| 3 | AI-managed profile | Persistent preferences across sessions | CAP-092 | Agent/user merge + audit |
| 4 | Reference library | Books, playbooks, frameworks on demand | CAP-094, CAP-090 | Versioned docs + RAG index |
| 5 | Entity notes graph | Recurring people, projects, topics | CAP-093 | Per-entity notes |

**Decision tree**

```text
All state fits in one JSON snapshot (< ~25K tokens)?     yes → Tier 1 only
Need "find X in my history" without full snapshot?       yes → add Tier 2 (CAP-091)
Agent should remember user patterns across sessions?     yes → add Tier 3 (CAP-092)
User uploads reference docs / playbooks?                   yes → add Tier 4 (CAP-094)
Recurring entities with free-form notes?                 yes → add Tier 5 (CAP-093)
```

**Dual execution path (Tier 1 + SC-01):** conversation mode hydrates snapshot into prompt layer 4 (CAP-037) and exposes **mutation-only** tools (CAP-039); plan worker uses **full** registry for reads and analysis (CAP-060 + CAP-044).

**Blackboard (optional):** CAP-070–073 for soft multi-turn intent when the user steers without explicit tool calls — not a substitute for Tier 1 snapshot on large domains.

---

## 1.6 Component 6 — Observability

Production agents require **request-level traceability** without locking to a single LLM vendor's dashboard.

**Correlation ID:** generate at API entry (or honor inbound header); propagate through loop, worker tasks, tool executions, and SSE channel.

**Per-LLM-call record (CAP-101):** at the CAP-001 adapter boundary, normalize `{input_tokens, output_tokens, latency_ms, estimated_cost}` into `AgentInteraction` rows keyed by `correlation_id`.

**SSE progress (CAP-100):** typed events — `token`, `plan_step`, `plan_failed`, `rate_limit` — for real-time serving (Part 3.1).

**Key metrics to monitor**

| Metric | Why |
|--------|-----|
| LLM latency p95 | User experience / SLA |
| Tokens per conversation | Cost control |
| Tool error rate | Domain or schema drift |
| Plan failure rate | Worker or synthesis issues |
| Queue depth / task age | Worker capacity |
| 429 retry count | Provider quota planning |
| Snapshot cache hit rate | CAP-037 efficiency |

This is **not** a full AgentOps platform chapter — export these signals to your existing logs, metrics, and dashboards.

# Part 2 — Design patterns

Each pattern maps to **SC-xx** scenarios and **CAP-xxx** bundles. Copy the scenario card, tick CAPs in Part 4, wire the assembly template.

---

## Pattern 1 — Prompt framework

**When to use:** Every agent — layered system prompt separates stable identity from dynamic context.

**When not to use:** Never skip entirely; SC-02 may use a minimal two-layer stack.

**Required components:** Model (CAP-001), Prompt (CAP-020–023), optional CAP-010 cache on stable layers.

**Scenario / CAP map**

| SC | Role | CAP-IDs |
|----|------|---------|
| all | Foundation + identity + recipe + dynamic context | CAP-020, CAP-021 |
| SC-01, SC-03 | Workflow recipe layer | CAP-022 |
| SC-02, SC-03 | Validate-before-LLM | CAP-023 |
| SC-01, SC-03 | Prompt cache blocks | CAP-010 |

**Example flow:** Factory builds `PromptBuilder().with_identity(identity).with_workflow(recipe).with_context(snapshot=…).build()` → passed as `system` to CAP-001.

**Assembly template:** T-01, T-02, or T-03 (all include CAP-020).

---

## Pattern 2 — RAG and structured extract

**When to use:** Batch ingest, bootstrap, or field extraction where LLM output is **structured JSON** driving domain writes (SC-02).

**When not to use:** Pure conversational Q&A with no extract step (SC-01 only).

**Required components:** Model (CAP-008, CAP-009), Vector tier optional (CAP-090, CAP-094), Tools (CAP-030, CAP-031).

**Scenario / CAP map — SC-02 · Field extractor / batch ingest**

**Pick when:** Fixed or batch input (repo snapshot, document, API payload) is ingested through a **scripted step chain**; one or more LLM steps emit **structured JSON** that drives domain writes; no ReAct chat loop.

**Typical flow (dual-tier):**

| Step | Type | Responsibility |
|------|------|----------------|
| 1 Gather | **Domain pipeline (non-CAP)** | Scan input into raw candidates (deterministic) |
| 2 D0 pre-filter | **Domain pipeline (non-CAP)** | Path/class/rules reject noise; merge duplicates on stable natural key |
| 3 D1 canonicalize | **CAP-008, CAP-009** | Planning-tier LLM batch: merge / reject / rename; parse failure must fail loud |
| 4 Cleanup | **Domain pipeline (non-CAP)** | Deterministic post-LLM rules (externals, denylist, cardinality caps) |
| 5 Propose writes | **Domain pipeline (non-CAP)** | Create/update/delete ops via domain service (often through SC-05 ChangeSet) |

Only D1 maps to CAP specs — Gather, D0, Cleanup, and Propose-writes are unit-testable product code in your domain package.

**Example flow:** CLI scans a repo → D0 drops tests/fixtures → D1 LLM merges duplicates → service proposes ChangeSet → CLI exits with op counts.

**Not this if:** User multi-turn chat steers the task (→ Pattern 4 / SC-01); steps are a fixed template graph with selective LLM nodes (→ Pattern 7 / SC-03).

**Often combined with:** Pattern 5 / SC-05 when writes go through approval / confidence gates.

**CAP-IDs (required):** 001, 004, 008, 009, 020, 030, 031, 120, 121, 122

**CAP-IDs (optional):** 005, 011, 023, 032, 036, 090, 091, 094

**Starting template:** T-02 Field

---

## Pattern 3 — Multi-agent communication

**When to use:** Domain events should trigger agent messages or plans **without** the user opening chat first (SC-04).

**When not to use:** All interactions start from user chat (→ Pattern 4 / SC-01).

**Required components:** Events (CAP-110), Model (CAP-001, CAP-002), Loop (CAP-040), Factory (CAP-120), optional Plan/Worker (CAP-050, CAP-060).

**Scenario / CAP map — SC-04 · Event-driven nudge**

**Pick when:** Something happens in the domain (ChangeSet merged, SLA breach, stale graph) and the system proactively notifies or plans without the user opening chat first.

**Example flow:** ChangeSet approved → event handler → short agent loop or enqueue plan → user gets notification or suggested next action.

**Not this if:** Every interaction starts from user chat (→ SC-01); only batch extract (→ SC-02).

**CAP-IDs (required):** 001, 002, 040, 110, 120

**CAP-IDs (optional):** 050, 060, 100, 101

**Starting template:** T-00 custom (CAP-110 + subset of SC-01 stack)

**Note:** This pattern describes **in-app event → agent** wiring — not a full A2A wire protocol spec. External agent-to-agent buses (A2A, ACP) are covered in Pattern 6.

---

## Pattern 4 — Conversational agents and roles

**When to use:** User opens chat, agent calls tools, work beyond one request becomes a background job (SC-01).

**Required components:** Loop (CAP-040–044), Plan (CAP-050), Worker (CAP-060), Context (CAP-037–039 when domain is large), Identities (CAP-121, CAP-122).

**Scenario / CAP map — SC-01 · Conversational planner**

**Pick when:** A user opens chat (or equivalent UI), sends natural-language messages, and the app runs a tool-calling loop; work that outlives one request is handed to a background worker.

**Example flow:** User: “Analyze auth module and propose a refactor plan” → agent calls read tools → creates durable plan → worker executes steps → user sees progress/completion.

**Not this if:** Input is a batch file/CI job with no conversation (→ SC-02 or SC-03); the agent only proposes writes pending approval with no chat loop (→ SC-05, optionally plus SC-01).

**Dual execution path (recommended for large domain state):** Chat uses CAP-037 snapshot in layer 4 + CAP-039 mutation-only tools. Plan worker (CAP-060) retains full read/analyze tools. Required when domain state is large; default in T-01; optional in bare SC-01 minimum.

**Hybrid worker (when background steps call LLM):** Include CAP-053, CAP-054, CAP-066 — mandatory when worker runs an LLM per step; see anti-patterns below.

**CAP-IDs (required):** 001, 002, 004, 020, 030, 031, 040, 044, 050, 051, 060, 062, 120, 121

**CAP-IDs (optional):** 003, 005, 006, 007, 010, 033, 037, 038, 039, 042, 043, 052, 053, 054, 061, 066, 070, 091, 092, 093, 100, 101

**Starting template:** T-01 Planner

### Anti-patterns (Pattern 4 + worker)

**Mechanical step execution**

**Symptom:** Worker runs pre-created `PlanStep` rows by parsing `action` strings and calling `ToolExecutor` **without an LLM call per step**.

**Fix:** Hybrid worker execution (CAP-053 + CAP-054 + CAP-066): each step gets workflow prompt + prior synthesis; LLM chooses tools before advancing.

**Proof:** PRF-SC01-06

**Assuming chat loop recovers worker failures**

**Symptom:** Plan fails in background; user waits forever; chat agent unaware.

**Fix:** CAP-100 SSE `plan_failed` event and/or inject failure context on next user message — CAP-040 does not auto-retry worker steps.

**Proof:** PRF-SC01-07

---

## Pattern 5 — Function calling and tool agents

**When to use:** Agent proposes **mutating or destructive** writes; human approval required before commit (SC-05); or any scenario using tool registry.

**Required components:** Tools (CAP-030–036), optional Loop (CAP-040).

**Scenario / CAP map — SC-05 · Governed mutations**

**Pick when:** The agent may call mutating or destructive tools but policy requires human approval before commit (HITL), with server-side identity on every tool call.

**Example flow:** Agent suggests `delete_element` → tool parks action as pending → UI shows approve/reject → only on approve does the service execute.

**Often combined with:** SC-01 or SC-02 (governance layer on top of planner or field agent).

**CAP-IDs (required):** 001, 030, 031, 033, 036

**CAP-IDs (optional):** 040, 050, 032

**Starting template:** T-00 custom (CAP-033, CAP-036 + base scenario CAPs)

### SC-02 × SC-05 · Full rescan invariants

**Applies when:** SC-02 performs a **full rescan** with delete ops and writes pass through SC-05.

**Invariant 1 — Confidence parity:** Delete ops on rescan use the same auto-apply policy as adds/updates.

**Invariant 2 — Delete before create:** When domain uses natural-key upserts, apply deletes before adds for the same rescan batch.

**Proof obligations:** PRF-SC02-03, PRF-SC02-04, PRF-SC05-02.

---

## Pattern 6 — Tool protocols (MCP, A2A, ACP)

**When to use:** External clients (IDE, remote agents) invoke tools via **MCP**; or you evaluate agent-to-agent buses for cross-system delegation.

**In-app vs external boundary**

| Layer | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| In-app `tools/` registry | CAP-030–036; domain services; HITL |
| External MCP server | Transport, auth, tool listing for clients — see playbook artifact **MCP FastMCP Reference Architecture** |
| A2A / ACP (conceptual) | Use when agents are **peers across systems** with their own runtime — prefer async handoff + durable plan (CAP-050) over synchronous chat coupling |

**When to choose MCP:** IDE or third-party agent needs discoverable tools with stdio or HTTP+SSE transport.

**When to choose in-app registry only:** Single deployed app with first-party UI — MCP optional.

**When to evaluate A2A/ACP:** Multiple autonomous agents owned by different teams/services need standardized delegation — start with event + plan enqueue (Pattern 3) before adopting a full protocol stack.

**CAP-IDs:** CAP-030, CAP-031, CAP-034 (schema); MCP server wiring is **not** duplicated here.

---

## Pattern 7 — Compiled pipeline

**When to use:** A trigger (schedule, webhook, CI, domain event handler) runs a **known step graph**; only some steps call the LLM (SC-03).

**Required components:** Plan (CAP-050), Worker (CAP-060), Model (CAP-001, CAP-002), Factory (CAP-120).

**Scenario / CAP map — SC-03 · Compiled pipeline**

**Pick when:** A trigger fires a known step graph; only some steps call the LLM.

**Example flow:** CI merge → enqueue compiled plan → worker runs data step → LLM planning step → assessment step → publish artifact.

**Not this if:** User multi-turn chat steers the task (→ SC-01); batch extract with D0/D1 chain (→ SC-02).

**CAP-IDs (required):** 001, 002, 004, 020, 050, 051, 053, 060, 061, 062, 120

**CAP-IDs (optional):** 054, 066, 100, 101

**Starting template:** T-03 Pipeline

---

# Part 3 — Serving modes

Serving mode determines **latency expectations**, **queueing**, and **progress reporting**. Pick one or combine real-time + batch.

> **Out of scope for this artifact:** Edge serving (on-device models), intelligent data pipelines, and full AgentOps platforms. Use Component 6 key metrics only.

---

## 3.1 Real-time serving

**Applies to:** Pattern 4 / SC-01, Pattern 3 event nudges with live UI, Pattern 5 with chat.

**Characteristics:**

- Synchronous request thread runs **CAP-040** bounded ReAct loop (default cap on iterations/tool calls).
- **CAP-003** streams tokens to client when chat UI supports partial render.
- **CAP-044** intercepts `create_plan` → enqueues worker → ends loop — user gets immediate ack while work continues async.
- **CAP-039** conversation mode keeps chat fast: snapshot reads in prompt, mutation-only tools exposed.
- **CAP-100** SSE channel publishes `token`, `tool_start`, `tool_end`, `plan_created` events keyed by `correlation_id`.

**Checklist**

- [ ] HTTP timeout > worst-case sync loop OR loop hands off to worker before timeout
- [ ] Streaming flushes on token boundaries (avoid buffering entire completion)
- [ ] Plan handoff returns `plan_id` to client for progress subscription
- [ ] CAP-101 records each LLM call in the sync path

---

## 3.2 Batch and queued serving

**Applies to:** Pattern 2 / SC-02 CLI ingest, Pattern 7 / SC-03 compiled pipelines, background portion of SC-01.

**Characteristics:**

- **CAP-060** Celery (or equivalent task broker) executes `execute_plan(plan_id)` outside the request thread.
- **CAP-062** enqueues with `transaction.on_commit` (or equivalent post-commit hook) so plan rows exist before worker starts.
- **CAP-061** dual-layer 429: in-call backoff (CAP-005) plus job state `waiting_retry` + broker retry.
- **CAP-063–065** durability: `acks_late`, orphan recovery beat, stale `running` reset.
- **CAP-066** per-step model tier: planning steps use large model; data/assessment steps use cheap tier.
- SC-02 exits with non-zero status on CAP-009 parse failure — never silent zero-op batch jobs.

**Checklist**

- [ ] Worker uses **CAP-039** `mode=workflow` (full tool registry)
- [ ] Idempotent step completion (CAP-052 atomic mark_started)
- [ ] Batch CLI maps domain errors to exit codes for CI
- [ ] Queue monitoring alerts on task age p95

---

## 3.3 Observability for serving

Bridges **Component 6** with runtime events:

| Event | Source | Consumer |

**Wire once:** middleware sets `correlation_id` → pass to `bounded_react_loop`, `execute_plan`, SSE publisher, and CAP-101 wrapper — same id end-to-end.

## 4.2 Capability specifications

Intro — each spec is a `# CAP-NNN` section below.

---

# CAP-001 · LLM Port protocol

**Job:** Single `complete()` entry point; all agents depend on protocol, never vendor SDK.
**Need when:** Any in-app LLM call (all scenarios).
**Skip when:** Never — if no LLM, skip entire agent architecture.
**Requires:** — | **Pairs with:** CAP-004, CAP-011 | **Module:** `llm/`

**Contract**
- `BaseLLM.complete(messages, system, max_tokens, temperature) -> LLMResponse`
- `LLMResponse`: `content`, `thinking`, `model`, `usage`, `stop_reason`
- `LLMError` on timeout/API failure

**Code — protocol**

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import Protocol, runtime_checkable

@dataclass
class LLMMessage:
    role: str  # system | user | assistant
    content: str

@dataclass
class LLMResponse:
    content: str
    model: str = ""
    usage: dict = field(default_factory=dict)
    stop_reason: str = "end_turn"
    thinking: str = ""

@runtime_checkable
class BaseLLM(Protocol):
    model_id: str
    def complete(
        self,
        messages: list[LLMMessage],
        system: str = "",
        max_tokens: int = 1024,
        temperature: float = 0.2,
    ) -> LLMResponse: ...

class LLMError(Exception):
    ...
```

**Wire:** `factory/` selects adapter; `loop/`, `worker/`, field agents call `complete()` only.

**Test:** `test_cap_001_adapter_satisfies_protocol`

**Fails if:** Agent imports Anthropic/OpenAI SDK directly — cannot swap providers or test with CAP-004.


---

# CAP-002 · Tool-calling generate

**Job:** LLM returns structured `tool_calls` alongside assistant text for ReAct loops.
**Need when:** SC-01, SC-03, SC-04 — any agent that invokes tools via the LLM protocol.
**Skip when:** SC-02 field extract only (JSON in content body, no tool-calling protocol).
**Requires:** CAP-001 | **Pairs with:** CAP-034, CAP-040 | **Module:** `llm/`

**Contract**
- `complete_with_tools(messages, system, tools, …) -> LLMResponse` extends CAP-001
- `LLMResponse.tool_calls: list[dict] | None` — normalized at adapter boundary
- Each call: `{id, name, arguments}` — arguments is a dict (never raw string)
- `stop_reason`: `end_turn` when no tools; `tool_use` when tool_calls present
- Adapters map Anthropic/OpenAI/Ollama shapes into this contract — loop never parses free text

**Code — protocol extension + adapter normalize**

```python
@dataclass
class LLMResponse:
    content: str
    tool_calls: list[dict] | None = None
    stop_reason: str = "end_turn"
    thinking: str = ""
    model: str = ""
    usage: dict | None = None

class BaseLLM(Protocol):
    def complete_with_tools(
        self,
        messages: list[LLMMessage],
        system: str,
        *,
        tools: list[dict],
        max_tokens: int = 4096,
        temperature: float = 0.2,
    ) -> LLMResponse: ...

def normalize_tool_calls(raw: dict) -> list[dict]:
    calls = []
    for tc in raw.get("tool_calls") or raw.get("tool_use") or []:
        calls.append({
            "id": tc.get("id", tc.get("call_id", "")),
            "name": tc["name"],
            "arguments": tc.get("input") or tc.get("arguments") or {},
        })
    return calls
```

**Wire:** `loop/react.py` calls `complete_with_tools`; pass tool schemas from CAP-034. Field agents (SC-02) use `complete()` only.

**Test:** `test_cap_002_tool_calls_round_trip`

**Fails if:** Loop regex-parses tool calls from assistant text — brittle and breaks on provider change.

---

# CAP-003 · Token stream

**Job:** Stream partial tokens to caller for live UI rendering.
**Need when:** SC-01 with live chat UI (pairs with CAP-100).
**Skip when:** Batch/field agents with no streaming UI.
**Requires:** CAP-001 | **Pairs with:** CAP-100 | **Module:** `llm/`

**Contract**
- `stream(messages, system) -> Iterator[str]` yields content deltas
- Separate from progress events (plan steps) in CAP-100

**Code — stream iterator**

```python
from collections.abc import Iterator

class BaseLLM(Protocol):
    def stream(
        self,
        messages: list[LLMMessage],
        system: str = "",
        *,
        max_tokens: int = 4096,
    ) -> Iterator[str]:
        ...
```

**Wire:** UI/SSE publisher consumes `stream()`; do not mix plan progress into token stream.

**Test:** `test_cap_003_stream_yields_deltas`

**Fails if:** Blocking `complete()` only — chat UI freezes until full response.

**Status:** sketch — implement when CAP-100 selected


---

# CAP-004 · ScriptedLLM

**Job:** Replay queued `LLMResponse` values in order — the only allowed LLM mock in integration tests.
**Need when:** All scenarios for CI agent proofs (§7).
**Skip when:** Production runtime — never deploy ScriptedLLM.
**Requires:** CAP-001 | **Pairs with:** — | **Module:** `llm/`

**Contract**
- Constructor takes ordered response strings or `LLMResponse` objects
- `complete()` pops next; raises `LLMError` when exhausted

**Code — test double**

```python
class ScriptedLLM:
    model_id = "scripted"

    def __init__(self, responses: list[str]) -> None:
        if not responses:
            raise ValueError("ScriptedLLM requires at least one response")
        self._responses = list(responses)
        self._index = 0

    def complete(self, messages, system="", max_tokens=1024, temperature=0.2) -> LLMResponse:
        if self._index >= len(self._responses):
            raise LLMError(f"ScriptedLLM exhausted after {len(self._responses)} calls")
        content = self._responses[self._index]
        self._index += 1
        return LLMResponse(content=content, model=self.model_id)
```

**Wire:** Inject via `factory.create_agent(..., llm=ScriptedLLM([...]))` in pytest only.

**Test:** `test_cap_004_scripted_replays_in_order`

**Fails if:** Mocking domain services or tools — hides real integration failures.


---

# CAP-005 · LLM retry backoff

**Job:** Exponential backoff wrapper for rate limits and transient LLM errors.
**Need when:** SC-01, SC-03 — any production LLM calls that may 429.
**Skip when:** Local-only dev with zero rate limits (still recommended).
**Requires:** CAP-001 | **Pairs with:** CAP-006, CAP-061 | **Module:** `llm/`

**Contract**
- Retry capped (e.g. min(30 * 2**(n-1), 120) seconds)
- Re-raise after max attempts

**Code — retry helper**

```python
import time
from typing import Callable, TypeVar

T = TypeVar("T")

def with_llm_retry(
    fn: Callable[[], T],
    *,
    max_attempts: int = 5,
    status_callback: Callable[[str, int, int], None] | None = None,
) -> T:
    for attempt in range(1, max_attempts + 1):
        try:
            return fn()
        except RateLimitError as exc:
            if attempt == max_attempts:
                raise
            delay = min(30 * (2 ** (attempt - 1)), 120)
            if status_callback:
                status_callback(str(exc), attempt, delay)
            time.sleep(delay)
    raise RuntimeError("unreachable")
```

**Wire:** Wrap adapter `complete()` calls in `loop/` and `worker/`; field agents use for long batch runs.

**Test:** `test_cap_005_retries_on_rate_limit`

**Fails if:** Uncaught 429 crashes agent mid-run with no resume path.


---

# CAP-006 · Retry status callback

**Job:** Notify caller during backoff so UI/logs show wait state without full SSE.
**Need when:** SC-01 — user-visible chat during rate-limit waits.
**Skip when:** Headless batch with no status surface.
**Requires:** CAP-005 | **Pairs with:** CAP-100 | **Module:** `llm/`

**Contract**
- Signature: `(message: str, attempt: int, delay_seconds: int) -> None`
- Called before each sleep in retry helper

**Code — callback usage**

```python
def on_rate_limit(message: str, attempt: int, delay: int) -> None:
    logger.info("rate_limit wait attempt=%s delay=%s msg=%s", attempt, delay, message)
    # optional: emit SSE rate_limit_status event (CAP-100)

with_llm_retry(lambda: llm.complete(msgs), status_callback=on_rate_limit)
```

**Wire:** Pass callback from `loop/` or conversation service into LLM retry wrapper.

**Test:** `test_cap_006_callback_fires_before_sleep`

**Fails if:** Silent 120s sleeps — users think the app hung.


---

# CAP-007 · Extended thinking request

**Job:** Enable provider reasoning budget on planning-heavy LLM calls.
**Need when:** SC-01/03 planning or narrative steps using Claude-style extended thinking.
**Skip when:** SC-02 field JSON extract; cheap assessment/data steps.
**Requires:** CAP-001 | **Pairs with:** CAP-008 | **Module:** `llm/`

**Contract**
- Optional param: `thinking={"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": N}`
- Default N illustrative: 8000 for planning tier

**Code — Anthropic-style request**

```python
response = client.messages.create(
    model=model,
    messages=messages,
    max_tokens=16000,
    thinking={"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": 8000},
)
```

**Wire:** Worker selects CAP-007 only for `is_planning=True` steps (CAP-053, CAP-066).

**Test:** `test_cap_007_thinking_enabled_on_planning_step`

**Fails if:** Thinking enabled on every call — cost/latency explosion on data steps.


---

# CAP-008 · Thinking response normalize

**Job:** Adapters return machine-parseable `content`; provider reasoning goes to `thinking`.
**Need when:** SC-02; any step that parses JSON from LLM output; all thinking models (Qwen3, Claude, o-series).
**Skip when:** Natural-language-only output, never parsed structurally.
**Requires:** CAP-001 | **Pairs with:** CAP-009 | **Module:** `llm/`

**Contract**
- `LLMResponse.content` — answer only (tags stripped)
- `LLMResponse.thinking` — optional trace; log at DEBUG only
- Normalize in adapter `_parse_response`, not in agent/runner

**Code — adapter parse (Ollama example)**

```python
from llm.structured import normalize_llm_text

def _parse_response(raw: dict) -> LLMResponse:
    message = raw.get("message") or {}
    thinking = str(message.get("thinking") or "")
    raw_content = str(message.get("content") or "")
    content = normalize_llm_text(raw_content)
    return LLMResponse(content=content, thinking=thinking, model=raw.get("model", ""))
```

**Wire:** Every provider adapter implements `_parse_response`; log content_chars/thinking_chars at INFO.

**Test:** `test_cap_008_thinking_field_separated_from_content`

**Fails if:** Parser sees `` or prose mixed with JSON → `None` → silent zero ops.


---

# CAP-009 · Structured JSON extract

**Job:** Shared strip + JSON parse for map/extract/metric steps.
**Need when:** SC-02; any `extract_json_*` consumer.
**Skip when:** Tool-calling or NL-only responses.
**Requires:** CAP-008 | **Pairs with:** — | **Module:** `llm/`

**Contract**
- `normalize_llm_text(raw) -> str`
- `extract_json_array(raw) -> list[dict] | None`
- `extract_json_object(raw) -> dict | None`
- Bracket/brace slice fallback on parse fail

**Code — extractors**

```python
import json
import re

_THINKING_RE = re.compile(r"<\s*think(?:ing)?\s*>[\s\S]*?<\s*/\s*think(?:ing)?\s*>", re.I)

def normalize_llm_text(raw: str) -> str:
    text = _THINKING_RE.sub("", raw or "").strip()
    return strip_markdown_fence(text)

def extract_json_array(raw: str) -> list[dict] | None:
    text = normalize_llm_text(raw)
    if not text:
        return None
    try:
        data = json.loads(text)
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        start, end = text.find("["), text.rfind("]")
        if start < 0 or end <= start:
            return None
        data = json.loads(text[start : end + 1])
    return [x for x in data if isinstance(x, dict)] if isinstance(data, list) else None
```

**Wire:** Single module imported by field agent and discovery runner — never duplicate parsers.

**Test:** `test_cap_009_thinking_wrapped_json_array_parses`

**Fails if:** Parse returns None but pipeline exits 0 with zero domain ops.


---

# CAP-010 · Prompt cache blocks

**Job:** Anthropic-style ephemeral cache on stable system prompt blocks.
**Need when:** SC-01/03 with repeated LLM calls sharing foundation prompt.
**Skip when:** Single-shot field extract (SC-02).
**Requires:** CAP-001, CAP-020 | **Pairs with:** CAP-021 | **Module:** `llm/`

**Contract**
- `system_blocks: list[dict]` with `cache_control: {type: ephemeral}` on stable layers
- Dynamic/user content never in cached blocks

**Code — system blocks**

```python
system_blocks = [
    {"type": "text", "text": FOUNDATION_PROMPT, "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}},

# CAP-037 · Context snapshot hydration

**Job:** Pre-compute structured user/domain state as JSON for prompt layer 4 (dynamic context).
**Need when:** SC-01 with dual execution path; domain state too large or too chatty to fetch via read tools each turn.
**Skip when:** SC-02 batch (single-shot input); SC-03 data steps pull sources directly; tiny domain where read tools in chat are acceptable without CAP-039.
**Requires:** — | **Pairs with:** CAP-038, CAP-039, CAP-010 | **Module:** `context/`

**Contract**
- `get_or_build(scope_id) -> dict` returns `{snapshot, version, generated_at}`
- Snapshot is structured JSON — intents, tasks, recent activity — not raw ORM dumps
- Inject into `PromptBuilder.with_context(snapshot=...)` (layer 4); never duplicate full snapshot in cached layers 1–3
- Typical TTL: 1–5 minutes in process cache or Redis; authoritative store optional

**Code — snapshot service**

```python
from django.core.cache import cache

class SnapshotService:
    TTL_SECONDS = 300

    def get_or_build(self, scope_id: str) -> dict:
        key = f"agent_snapshot:{scope_id}"
        cached = cache.get(key)
        if cached:
            return cached
        snapshot = self._build_from_domain(scope_id)
        payload = {
            "snapshot": snapshot,
            "version": self._next_version(scope_id),
            "generated_at": timezone.now().isoformat(),
        }
        cache.set(key, payload, self.TTL_SECONDS)
        return payload

    def _build_from_domain(self, scope_id: str) -> dict:
        ...  # aggregate via domain services — not LLM
```

**Wire:** Chat handler calls `get_or_build` before `bounded_react_loop`; worker may bypass snapshot and use read tools (CAP-039).

**Test:** `test_cap_037_snapshot_injected_into_prompt`

**Fails if:** Chat loop calls dozens of read tools per message while CAP-037 selected — dual path not wired.

# CAP-038 · Snapshot invalidation hooks

**Job:** Invalidate or bump snapshot version when domain mutations occur so chat never reads stale layer-4 context.
**Need when:** CAP-037 in use; any write tool or background job mutates entities in the snapshot.
**Skip when:** Snapshot is immutable for the session (read-only copilot).
**Requires:** CAP-037 | **Pairs with:** CAP-039 | **Module:** `context/`

**Contract**
- Domain mutation (signal, service post-commit, or write-tool success) → `invalidate(scope_id)` or `bump_version(scope_id)`
- Invalidation is cheap (delete cache key); rebuild is lazy on next `get_or_build`
- Write tools MUST trigger invalidation after successful commit

**Code — invalidation hook**

```python
def invalidate(self, scope_id: str) -> None:
    cache.delete(f"agent_snapshot:{scope_id}")

@receiver(post_save, sender=DomainEntity)
def on_entity_changed(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    SnapshotService().invalidate(instance.scope_id)
```

**Wire:** Register hooks for every entity type included in CAP-037 snapshot; call from write-tool executor on success.

**Test:** `test_cap_038_mutation_bumps_snapshot_version`

**Fails if:** User completes a write in chat but next message still sees pre-mutation snapshot.

# CAP-039 · Dual tool exposure

**Job:** Same tool registry; orchestrator exposes different subsets by execution mode.
**Need when:** CAP-037 hydrates reads in chat — expose **mutation-only** tools in conversation; **full** registry in plan worker.
**Skip when:** All tools are reads, or chat latency/cost of read tools is acceptable without snapshot.
**Requires:** CAP-030, CAP-031, CAP-037 | **Pairs with:** CAP-044, CAP-060 | **Module:** `context/`

**Contract**
- Modes: `conversation` | `workflow`
- `conversation`: `WRITE_TOOLS` allowlist only (create/update/complete — project-defined)
- `workflow`: full registry (reads, analyze, list, mutate)
- MCP server may register all tools; **factory** passes mode into `ToolExecutor`
- Attempt to call non-exposed tool → `{success: false, error: "tool not exposed in conversation mode"}`

**Code — mode-aware executor**

```python
class ToolExecutor:
    def __init__(self, registry: dict, *, mode: str = "conversation"):
        self.registry = registry
        self.mode = mode
        self.write_tools = frozenset(registry.keys()) & WRITE_TOOLS

    def exposed_names(self) -> frozenset[str]:
        if self.mode == "workflow":
            return frozenset(self.registry.keys())
        return self.write_tools

    def execute(self, tool_call: dict) -> dict:
        name = tool_call["name"]
        if name not in self.exposed_names():
            return {"success": False, "result": None, "error": f"tool {name!r} not exposed in {self.mode} mode"}
        ...
```

**Wire:** `PlannerAgent` / CAP-040 uses `mode=conversation`; `execute_plan` worker uses `mode=workflow`.

**Test:** `test_cap_039_conversation_blocks_read_tool`

**Fails if:** Chat agent still fan-outs read tools while CAP-037 snapshot is present — cost/latency unchanged.

# CAP-091 · Semantic context search

**Job:** Natural-language query → ranked subset of entities from large domain state (Tier 2 memory).
**Need when:** Snapshot alone exceeds token budget; user asks "find logs about X" or "objectives due this week".
**Skip when:** Tier-1 snapshot fits comfortably; SC-02 batch with fixed input.
**Requires:** CAP-030, CAP-031 | **Pairs with:** CAP-037, CAP-090 | **Module:** `knowledge/`

**Contract**
- Single tool: `semantic_context_search(scope_id, query, entity_types?, limit?) -> {results, metadata}`
- Embedding similarity or indexed search over entity text fields
- Returns snippets + relevance scores — not full snapshot
- LLM may call instead of assuming full state is in layer 4

**Code — search tool**

```python
def semantic_context_search(
    scope_id: str,
    query: str,
    *,
    entity_types: list[str] | None = None,
    limit: int = 20,
) -> dict:
    embedding = embed(query)
    hits = index.search(scope_id, embedding, types=entity_types, limit=limit)
    return {"query": query, "results": hits, "metadata": {"count": len(hits)}}
```

**Wire:** Register in workflow mode always; in conversation mode only if snapshot alone is insufficient (optional read).

**Test:** `test_cap_091_semantic_search_returns_ranked_hits`

**Fails if:** Entire history embedded in every prompt instead of query-time retrieval.


---

# CAP-092 · AI-managed profile memory

**Job:** Persistent, agent-updatable user profile (preferences, patterns, strengths, constraints) — Tier 3.
**Need when:** Personalization across sessions; agent should remember stable facts without re-deriving from logs.
**Skip when:** Anonymous or ephemeral agents; profile owned by explicit user settings UI only.
**Requires:** CAP-030, CAP-031 | **Pairs with:** CAP-037 | **Module:** `knowledge/`

**Contract**
- Store: structured JSON profile per user with version + `updated_by` (agent | user)
- Tool: `update_user_profile(scope_id, patch, rationale)` — merge patch; audit changes
- Inject summary slice into layer 4 (not full history)
- Human review recommended for sensitive fields (optional gate)

**Code — profile patch**

```python
def update_user_profile(scope_id: str, patch: dict, *, rationale: str) -> dict:
    profile = Profile.objects.select_for_update().get(scope_id=scope_id)
    profile.data = deep_merge(profile.data, patch)
    profile.version += 1
    profile.save()
    AuditLog.record(scope_id, patch, rationale)
    return profile.data
```

**Wire:** Expose update tool in workflow or governed conversation writes; inject `profile_summary` in PromptBuilder.

**Test:** `test_cap_092_profile_patch_persists`

**Fails if:** Agent re-encodes same preferences in every conversation from scratch.


---

# CAP-093 · Entity notes graph

**Job:** Free-form notes attached to recurring entities (people, projects, topics) — Tier 5.
**Need when:** User works with repeating entities; context is relational not flat.
**Skip when:** Domain has no entity graph or notes are stored only in primary records.
**Requires:** CAP-030, CAP-031 | **Pairs with:** CAP-091 | **Module:** `knowledge/`

**Contract**
- Tools: `get_entity_notes(entity_type, entity_id)`, `upsert_entity_note(...)`, optional `link_entities`
- Notes are user/agent authored text + tags; searchable via CAP-091
- Inject relevant notes into layer 4 when `context_type`/`context_id` matches

**Code — note upsert**

```python
def upsert_entity_note(
    scope_id: str,
    entity_type: str,
    entity_id: str,
    body: str,
    *,
    tags: list[str] | None = None,
) -> dict:
    note, _ = EntityNote.objects.update_or_create(
        scope_id=scope_id,
        entity_type=entity_type,
        entity_id=entity_id,
        defaults={"body": body, "tags": tags or []},
    )
    return {"id": note.pk, "entity_type": entity_type, "entity_id": entity_id}
```

**Wire:** Domain-specific entity types; index note text for CAP-091.

**Test:** `test_cap_093_note_retrieved_for_active_context`

**Fails if:** Same entity context re-explained every session with no note retention.


---

# CAP-094 · Reference knowledge library

**Job:** Ingest, version, and store reference documents (books, playbooks, frameworks) for RAG — Tier 4 store.
**Need when:** Agent should cite or apply user-provided reference material on demand.
**Skip when:** All guidance lives in foundation prompt / skills only.
**Requires:** — | **Pairs with:** CAP-090 | **Module:** `knowledge/`

**Contract**
- Ingest pipeline: upload → chunk → embed → index (async job acceptable)
- Metadata: `doc_type`, `title`, `version`, `tags`
- CAP-090 `search_knowledge` queries this index — do not duplicate indexes

**Code — ingest stub**

```python
def ingest_reference_document(
    scope_id: str,
    title: str,
    content: str,
    *,
    doc_type: str = "playbook",
) -> dict:
    doc = ReferenceDocument.objects.create(scope_id=scope_id, title=title, doc_type=doc_type)
    chunks = chunk_text(content)
    index.upsert(doc.id, chunks)
    return {"document_id": doc.id, "chunks": len(chunks)}
```

**Wire:** Admin or API upload; CAP-090 registered when Tier 4 enabled.

**Test:** `test_cap_094_ingest_then_search_knowledge_hit`

**Fails if:** CAP-090 searches ad-hoc files with no versioned library backing.

# CAP-101 · Agent interaction trace

**Job:** End-to-end traceability: correlation_id from API entry through LLM calls; normalized usage, latency, cost per interaction.
**Need when:** Any production agent (all scenarios); required for support, cost control, debugging.
**Skip when:** Local dev only with DEBUG logging (still recommended).
**Requires:** CAP-001 | **Pairs with:** CAP-006, CAP-100 | **Module:** `observability/`

**Contract**
- **Provider-agnostic at orchestrator boundary** — adapters map vendor usage fields into `LLMResponse.usage`
- `correlation_id`: propagated from HTTP header or generated at API entry; attached to logs, worker tasks, SSE events
- `AgentInteraction` record per LLM call: `{correlation_id, conversation_id, plan_id?, model, input_tokens, output_tokens, latency_ms, estimated_cost}`
- Cost = `tokens × rate_table(model_id)` — rates in config, not hard-coded in agents
- Tool executions log `{correlation_id, tool_name, success, duration_ms}` separately from LLM cost

**Code — trace wrapper**

```python
@dataclass
class AgentInteraction:
    correlation_id: str
    model: str
    input_tokens: int
    output_tokens: int
    latency_ms: int
    estimated_cost: Decimal

def traced_complete(llm: BaseLLM, *, correlation_id: str, **kwargs) -> LLMResponse:
    started = time.monotonic()
    resp = llm.complete(**kwargs)
    latency_ms = int((time.monotonic() - started) * 1000)
    AgentInteraction.objects.create(
        correlation_id=correlation_id,
        model=resp.model,
        input_tokens=resp.usage.get("input_tokens", 0),
        output_tokens=resp.usage.get("output_tokens", 0),
        latency_ms=latency_ms,
        estimated_cost=estimate_cost(resp.model, resp.usage),
    )
    logger.info("llm_complete correlation_id=%s model=%s latency_ms=%s", correlation_id, resp.model, latency_ms)
    return resp
```

**Wire:** Middleware sets `correlation_id`; pass through loop, worker, SSE publisher; never rely on provider-specific log formats in agent code.

**Test:** `test_cap_101_correlation_id_links_api_to_interaction_row`

**Fails if:** Support asks for a failure timestamp and only provider dashboard exists — no request-level trace.

# CAP-040 · Bounded ReAct loop

**Job:** LLM↔tools iterate until `end_turn` or iteration cap; optional plan handoff callback.
**Need when:** SC-01, SC-04 — conversational or event-triggered tool-calling agents.
**Skip when:** SC-02 batch extract; SC-03 compiled pipeline worker (uses CAP-060 step loop instead).
**Requires:** CAP-001, CAP-002, CAP-031 | **Pairs with:** CAP-043, CAP-044 | **Module:** `loop/`

**Contract**
- Hard cap on iterations (default 10) and optional tool-call count
- Each round: `complete_with_tools` → if no `tool_calls`, return assistant text
- Append `{role: tool, tool_call_id, content}` messages for each executed tool
- Tool results come from CAP-031 envelope — never raise into loop
- Optional `on_plan_created(plan_id) -> str` hook for CAP-044 intercept
- When cap exceeded, delegate to CAP-043 force-final (if selected)

**Code — bounded loop**

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Callable

@dataclass
class ToolCall:
    id: str
    name: str
    arguments: dict

def bounded_react_loop(
    llm,

    max_iter: int = 10,
    on_plan_created: Callable[[int], str] | None = None,
) -> str:
    for _ in range(max_iter):
        resp = llm.complete_with_tools(messages, system, tools=tool_schemas)
        if not resp.tool_calls:
            return resp.content or ""
        for tc in resp.tool_calls:
            if tc["name"] == "create_plan" and on_plan_created:
                result = executor.execute(tc)
                if result.get("success") and result.get("result", {}).get("plan_id"):
                    return on_plan_created(result["result"]["plan_id"])
            envelope = executor.execute(tc)
            messages.append({

                "content": envelope.get("result") if envelope.get("success") else envelope.get("error", ""),
            })
    return force_final_answer(llm, messages, system, tool_schemas=tool_schemas)
```

**Wire:** Factory passes `tool_schemas` from CAP-034; wire `on_plan_created` when CAP-044 selected. Wrap `llm` with CAP-101 trace wrapper in production.

**Test:** `test_cap_040_tool_round_trip_and_cap`

**Fails if:** Loop calls `complete()` without tools while agent scenario requires tool use — SC-01 cannot function.

# CAP-044 · Plan handoff intercept

**Job:** On successful `create_plan` tool call: persist plan, enqueue worker on commit, stop ReAct loop with user ack.
**Need when:** SC-01 — chat hands durable work to background worker (CAP-060).
**Skip when:** All work completes synchronously in the chat loop; SC-03-only pipelines enqueue without chat loop.
**Requires:** CAP-040, CAP-050, CAP-062 | **Pairs with:** CAP-100 | **Module:** `loop/`

**Contract**
- Intercept inside CAP-040 when tool name is `create_plan` and envelope reports success + `plan_id`
- Call CAP-062 enqueue (`on_commit`) before returning to user
- Return brief summary string — do **not** continue iterating in the sync loop
- Worker runs with CAP-039 `mode=workflow` (full tool registry)

**Code — handoff hook**

```python
def make_plan_handoff(*, conversation_id: str, enqueue_fn) -> callable:
    def on_plan_created(plan_id: int) -> str:
        enqueue_fn(plan_id)  # CAP-062: transaction.on_commit(lambda: execute_plan.delay(plan_id))
        return f"Plan #{plan_id} queued — you'll see progress as steps complete."

    tool_schemas=self.tool_schemas,
    on_plan_created=make_plan_handoff(conversation_id=conv_id, enqueue_fn=self._enqueue_plan),
)
```

**Wire:** Pass hook from conversation service into CAP-040; publish CAP-100 `plan_created` SSE after enqueue.

**Test:** `test_cap_044_handoff_stops_loop_and_enqueues`

**Fails if:** Loop continues after create_plan — user waits on HTTP timeout while worker runs.

# CAP-050 · Durable plan model

**Job:** Persist `ExecutionPlan` + ordered `PlanStep` rows that survive process crash and worker retry.
**Need when:** SC-01, SC-03 — any async multi-step agent work.
**Skip when:** Single-shot sync chat with no background execution.
**Requires:** — | **Pairs with:** CAP-051, CAP-062 | **Module:** `plan/`

**Contract**
- `ExecutionPlan`: `{id, status, context_json, created_at, conversation_id?}`
- `PlanStep`: `{plan_id, order, action, tool_name?, args_json, status, result_json, error, llm_synthesis?}`
- Plan statuses: `pending`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`
- Steps ordered by `order` field; worker advances sequentially unless CAP-055 adapt
- `from_template(template_id, context)` factory for SC-03 compiled pipelines

**Code — models (reference impl)**

```python
class ExecutionPlan(models.Model):
    PENDING, RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED = "pending", "running", "completed", "failed"
    status = models.CharField(max_length=20, default=PENDING)
    context_json = models.JSONField(default=dict)

    llm_synthesis = models.TextField(blank=True)
```

**Wire:** Created by CAP-044 `create_plan` tool or SC-03 `enqueue_compiled_plan`; consumed by CAP-060 worker.

**Test:** `test_cap_050_plan_persists_ordered_steps`

**Fails if:** Plan state lives only in memory — crash loses in-flight agent work.

# CAP-051 · Step state machine

**Job:** Enforce `pending → running → completed|failed|waiting_retry` transitions; completed steps never re-run.
**Need when:** SC-01, SC-03 — any CAP-050 durable plan executed by CAP-060.
**Skip when:** No durable plan model selected.
**Requires:** CAP-050 | **Pairs with:** CAP-052, CAP-061 | **Module:** `plan/`

**Contract**
- Valid transitions only; terminal states (`completed`, `failed`) are immutable
- `waiting_retry` re-enters from CAP-061 429 handling
- `next_pending()` returns lowest-order step with status `pending` or `waiting_retry`
- Worker skips `completed` steps on resume — idempotent retry semantics

**Code — state helpers**

```python
STEP_PENDING = "pending"
STEP_RUNNING = "running"
STEP_COMPLETED = "completed"
STEP_FAILED = "failed"
STEP_WAITING = "waiting_retry"

TERMINAL = frozenset({STEP_COMPLETED, STEP_FAILED})

class ExecutionPlan(models.Model):
    def next_pending(self) -> PlanStep | None:
        return self.steps().filter(status__in=[STEP_PENDING, STEP_WAITING]).first()
```

**Wire:** CAP-060 worker loop calls `next_pending()` → execute → `mark_completed` / `mark_failed` / `mark_waiting_retry`.

**Test:** `test_cap_051_completed_step_not_rerun_on_retry`

**Fails if:** Worker re-executes completed steps after 429 retry — duplicate side effects.

# CAP-060 · Async plan worker

**Job:** Background task loops pending plan steps via `execute_single_step` outside the HTTP request thread.
**Need when:** SC-01, SC-03 — durable work that outlives the sync chat or trigger request.
**Skip when:** All agent work completes synchronously in CAP-040 with no plan model.
**Requires:** CAP-050, CAP-051 | **Pairs with:** CAP-061, CAP-062, CAP-066 | **Module:** `worker/`

**Contract**
- Entry: `execute_plan(plan_id)` — shared task or equivalent broker job
- CAP-052 `mark_started` on plan — only one worker owns a plan at a time
- Loop: while `step := plan.next_pending()`: `execute_single_step(plan, step)`
- `execute_single_step` uses CAP-039 `mode=workflow` (full tools); hybrid LLM steps use CAP-053/054/066
- On unhandled failure: mark plan `failed`, emit CAP-100 `plan_failed`
- Never run steps as dumb action-string scripts without LLM when hybrid flags set (see Pattern 4 anti-patterns)

**Code — worker task (reference impl)**

```python
@shared_task(bind=True, acks_late=True)
def execute_plan(self, plan_id: int) -> None:

# CAP-062 · on_commit enqueue

**Job:** Enqueue background worker only after the DB transaction that created the plan commits successfully.
**Need when:** SC-01, SC-03 — any CAP-044 handoff or compiled pipeline enqueue.
**Skip when:** Plan rows are created outside a transaction (single autocommit statement) — still prefer explicit commit boundary.
**Requires:** CAP-060 | **Pairs with:** CAP-044 | **Module:** `worker/`

**Contract**
- Never call `execute_plan.delay(plan_id)` inside an uncommitted transaction
- Worker must see committed `ExecutionPlan` + `PlanStep` rows on first read
- Use framework post-commit hook: Django `transaction.on_commit`, SQLAlchemy `after_commit`, etc.

**Code — enqueue helper**

```python
from django.db import transaction

def enqueue_plan_after_commit(plan_id: int) -> None:
    transaction.on_commit(lambda: execute_plan.delay(plan_id))

# CAP-044 handoff:
def on_plan_created(plan_id: int) -> str:
    enqueue_plan_after_commit(plan_id)
    return f"Plan #{plan_id} queued."

# SC-03 compiled pipeline:
def enqueue_compiled_plan(template_id: str, context: dict) -> int:
    plan = ExecutionPlan.from_template(template_id, context)
    plan.save()
    enqueue_plan_after_commit(plan.id)
    return plan.id
```

**Wire:** All plan creation paths (chat handoff, event handler, CI trigger) call this helper — never raw `.delay()` adjacent to uncommitted ORM writes.

**Test:** `test_cap_062_worker_sees_committed_plan_rows`

**Fails if:** Worker starts before commit — `DoesNotExist` or partial step set race.
