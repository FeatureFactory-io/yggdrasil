## Purpose
Plan a new feature implementation by analyzing requirements, assessing codebase state, creating detailed implementation plan, and preparing for execution.

## Prerequisites
- Feature specification or idea for what needs to be built
- Access to codebase and documentation

## Steps

### Step 0: Reset and Prepare
Reset your task plan. If there was work in progress on another task, create a TODO.md file documenting what was being worked on, what was completed, what remains to be done, and any blockers or notes.

### Step 1: Understand Architecture
Read `docs/architecture/SAO.md` (if exists) to identify architectural patterns and principles relevant to this implementation. **Note which section headings govern this feature — you will need these in Step 6.**

### Step 2: Understand User Journey
Check `docs/features/user_journey.md` (if exists) to understand what you're building and how it integrates with other parts of the system.

### Step 3: Analyze Feature Specification
Read the feature specification thoroughly. If none exists, propose creating one first.

Follow BDD/Gherkin format: one scenario = one user goal; 5–10 steps max; GIVEN-WHEN-THEN structure; independently executable. Step phrases must reuse patterns from `docs/features/CATALOG.md` or explicitly add a new catalogued step via TFK-07.

### Step 4: Assess Codebase State

a) **Identify reusable components:** list components/services/models that can be reused; verify they're not stubs.

b) **Check test coverage:** for any reusable components without tests, add test creation to the plan.

c) **Build context map:** identify 3–5 `file:line_range` locations an implementor must read. Format:
```
| file | lines | one-line note |
```
If you cannot identify 3 meaningful references, the codebase assessment in step (a) is incomplete.

d) **Detect MCP / Agent surface:**
   - Check SAO §18 — is MCP in scope for this feature?
     If yes: locate `mcp/server.py` (or equivalent). Verify `initialize_mcp()` exists and is called on startup. If missing: add initialization to the plan before any tool registration step.
   - Check SAO §17 — does this feature add or extend agent capabilities?
     If yes: locate `ToolExecutor` (artifact 56 §4.3). Verify it is instantiated and injected into the agent loop. If missing: add ToolExecutor initialization to the plan before service wiring.
   - Record findings as additional one-liners in the Context Map:
     `mcp/server.py | <line> | FastMCP singleton — register new tools here`
     `llm/executor.py | <line> | ToolExecutor — wire service callables here`
     Skip a row if that surface is not in scope.

### Step 5: Clarification Questions
Ask clarification questions scenario-by-scenario. If >5 questions total, create `FEAT_X.Y.Z_Clarifications.md` for batch answers.

### Step 6: Create Implementation Plan

**Mandatory Section A — Context Map** (from Step 4c)
**Mandatory Section B — Do-Not-Do List** (derived from SAO.md sections)
**Mandatory Section C — SAO.md Sections That Apply**
**Mandatory Section D — Tests to Create** (each row must state what it asserts). When Section E has rows, also list `test_*_log_story_happy` and/or `test_*_log_story_reject` (pytest + caplog; integration or view level).
**Mandatory Section E — Log Story Script** (formerly Logs to Emit). Each row is a beat the implementor must emit and prove with caplog. Never defer logging to a final slice.
```
## Log Story Script
| Where | Beat | Trigger | Must include |
|-------|------|---------|--------------|
| `LoginView.post` | entry | method called | email= (never password) |
| `LoginView.post` | branch | bad credentials | authentication failed |
| `LoginView.post` | exit | success | login success, user_pk= |
```
Beats vocabulary: `entry | config | validation | processing | branch | exit | error`.
Do not cite dropped rule `add-logging`.

**Mandatory Section F — MCP Tools to Expose** (skip with "Not applicable" if MCP not in scope):
```
## MCP Tools to Expose
| Tool name | Service method | Write? | HITL? | Auth injection |
|-----------|---------------|--------|-------|----------------|
| `create_foo` | `FooService.create` | Yes | No | server-side user_id |
```
Rules: artifact 57 §3.2 (tool schema), §3.3 (auth injection — never accept user_id from args), §3.4 (write-tool policy)

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Backend Implementation:** models, admin, services, views, URLs. Follow the Rules section below.

6. **MCP Tool Registration (if SAO §18 in scope):**
   - Declare the tool in `mcp/tools/` wrapping the service method; apply server-side auth injection.
   - Register with `initialize_mcp()`.
   - Apply stdout hygiene if stdio transport (artifact 57 §6).
   - Reference: artifact 57 §3–§4

7. **ToolExecutor Wiring (if SAO §17 in scope):**
   - Register the service callable in `ToolExecutor` under the tool name expected by the agent loop.
   - Ensure the return envelope matches the stable format.
   - Mark as HITL if destructive.
   - Reference: artifact 56 §4.3

2. **Frontend Implementation:** Django templates, HTMX, partials, `data-testid` attributes.

3. **Testing — prove what's working:** behavior tests red → green → refactor. Unit, integration (no mocks), view tests. Then **log-story tests red → green** in the same slice (caplog / `assert_log_story`).
   **MCP tools** (if Section F populated): Tests to Create table must include T1 + T2 per new tool; T3 required if stdio:
   - T1 (FastMCP Client): `async with Client(transport=mcp) as c: await c.call_tool(...)` — proves schema, registration
   - T2 (Direct service): call service with real DB — proves service/ORM wiring
   - T3 (subprocess JSON-RPC): proves entrypoint cleanliness (no stdout noise)
   - Full recipes: artifact 57 §7

4. **Observability:** emit INFO at decision points matching the Log Story Script (who/what/when/why, never raw secrets). Prove with caplog tests — ban deferred "informative logging pass" slices.

5. **Commit Strategy:** Angular convention after every principal step. Behavior + log-story green in the same commit when Section E is populated. When GitHub issue #N will hand off this plan: list **one commit per implementation slice** in the plan; first commit is plan/docs handoff only (`docs(plan): … Refs #N`); slice commits use `Refs #N`; final slice uses `Closes #N`. Each slice requires `gh issue comment N` with commit SHA (rule `do-github-issues`).

### Steps 7–10: Rule Confirmation, No Time Estimates, Submit for Approval, GitHub Issue

Issue body must contain all six mandatory sections inline (A–F, not linked). Each section must be self-sufficient for a cold-start implementor. When used under PIN, note that `checkpoint.log_story_command` must pass alongside the behavior checkpoint.

### Step 7: Write Lessons Learned

Before creating the GitHub issue, add a `## Lessons Learned` section to the issue body.

**The question is open-ended:** *Completing this story — what difficulties did you encounter? How could the task definition, tools, and artifacts you received have been improved to make accomplishing this task easier, without creating extra duplicates or contradictions elsewhere?*

This is not a finite list of categories. Write freely. If something matters, write it down. Areas that often surface signal (use them if they apply, ignore if they don't):
- Missing or unclear artifacts (mockups, SAO sections, feature files, skills)
- Activity steps that contradicted each other, the feature spec, or `user_journey.md`
- Technical decisions made during planning not yet in `docs/architecture/SAO.md`
- Deviations from the written BDD scenarios (scope narrowed, step reworded, constraint added)

If nothing to note: `## Lessons Learned — None.`

One honest sentence beats four empty bullet points. The reader is MIN-05 closing the iteration and PIN-02 opening the next one.

### Step 8: GitHub Issue Handoff (**hard gate — blocks BPE-02 / MIN-04 code**)

After user approves the plan and **before any implementation slice** (including spec/Gherkin):

1. Create GitHub issue #N — body inlines sections A–F + `## Lessons Learned` placeholder + checkpoint YAML when used under PIN.
2. Update plan INDEX with issue #N and plan link.
3. Commit **docs/plan only**: `docs(plan): {wave} plan and GitHub issue #N` with footer `Refs #N`.
4. Post issue comment citing handoff commit SHA and listing slice order from the plan.

**Do not** modify `src/`, `tests/` implementation, or production templates until step 3 is committed and step 4 is posted.

## Rules

Before planning and writing the implementation plan, **read** each Rule below in this playbook (by slug), then **apply** it when filling Mandatory Sections D–E and the Implementation Steps. Do not rely on memory of the rule text.

Required:
- `do-plan-before-doing`
- `do-skeletons-first`
- `do-test-first`
- `do-not-mock-in-integration-tests`
- `do-informative-logging`
- `do-assert-log-story`
- `do-write-concise-methods`
- `do-docstring-format`
- `do-semantic-versioning-on-ui-elements`
- `do-follow-commit-convention`
- `do-small-increments`
- `pytest`
- `do-github-issues`

Activity-specific (not a substitute for the rules above):
- Mandatory Section E is a **Log Story Script** (Where / Beat / Trigger / Must include); Section D must name matching `*_log_story_*` tests when Section E is non-empty.
- Logging ships in the same green slice as behavior — ban deferred logging passes.

## Success Criteria
- Feature specification exists and is clear
- Codebase assessment complete with context map (3–5 file:line_range references)
- Plan contains all six mandatory sections: Context Map, Do-Not-Do, SAO Sections, Tests to Create, Log Story Script, MCP Tools to Expose
- All tests explicitly listed with what they prove, including `*_log_story_*` when Section E has rows
- All log decision points listed with Beat + required context fields
- If MCP tools added: Tests to Create table contains T1+T2 rows per new tool (T3 if stdio)
- Plan reviewed and approved by user
- GitHub issue created/updated with all mandatory sections inline
- `## Lessons Learned` section present in the issue body
- Handoff commit `docs(plan): … Refs #N` exists **before** any implementation commit for this feature
- Plan lists slice commit boundaries; issue #N created with A–F inline before BPE-02
